# connecting-the-dots

The Game
A connect-the-dots game for two players.

Definitions
octilinear line - a horizontal, vertical, or 45Â° diagonal line
Rules
The game is played on a 4x4 grid of 16 nodes.
Players take turns drawing octilinear lines connecting nodes.
Each line must begin at the start or end of the existing path, so that all lines form a continuous path.
The first line may begin on any node.
A line may connect any number of nodes.
Lines may not intersect.
No node can be visited twice.
The game ends when no valid lines can be drawn.
The player who draws the last line is the loser.
Example Game
Each move is numbered. Lines that connect more that two nodes have each segment numbered. Player 1 made the odd numbered moves and Player 2 made the even numbered moves. Player 1 made the first move (1) and was forced to make the last move (9). Thus, Player 2 won.
